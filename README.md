# Top 200 North American Touring Artists and their Instagram followers
This dataset was origionally from Pollstar, and I added on the Instagram Followers, Years Active, and Number Of Members columns. This data was taken from Wikipedia and Instagram. Tours with multiple bands or artists had their years active averaged together.
The main question I am looking to answer here is, how much do Instagram followers influence the money an artist makes, and is having more experience worth more than that.
